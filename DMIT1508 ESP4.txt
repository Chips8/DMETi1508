1NF - 
Supplier#- supplier description, supplier address, supplier name, supplier city, phone, date, sub, GST, total, PO#(PK)
Item #(pk) - supplier item # depends on the supplier, supp des, city, cost, amount, PO#(pk)
can use supplier item# as PK but item# is best
2NF partial identification:
Nothing
3NF - Date, sub, GST, total, supp #
Supp#, supplier amount, city, phone , 

Supp item:
supp #

|| ---<
PO:
PO# wwwwwww

|| --- <
Item# + PO#
customer partial payments but we cant to companies
Cheque register

Date, Cheque #, cheque amount, supplier#, supplier name, purchase order #, PO date --> 0NF - set PO# as PK

1NF: all atomic, no repeating groups:

Repeating groups[PO#, amount, date]
supplier # - supplier name
cheque # - cheque amount- date
PO#, supplier #, PO date, cheque #

chq#(po#) date, chq amt, supp#, supp name
po#(pk), podate, chq#(fk)

2NF - partial dependency:
nothing
3NF - 
chq # - one date, chq amt, supp#
supp#, supp name 
po#, po date, chq#

supplier ||--<
cheque ||--<
PO

cheque could brnach of supp item 
ex. supp item || . . . < cheque#
Country || -- < Region || -- < City
Natural nested relationship
country, country ID(pk), [Regional ID, regional name, City ID, city name]
1NF - atomic
Country ID, country name
Regional ID, Regional name, City iD(pk)< City name, Country ID(FK)
2NF- nothing, no partial dependency
3NF- Country ID, country name,
Regional ID(pk), City ID(pk), city name ,Country ID(fk) 
Region ID(pk), Region name
1 country has many cities, region has many cities
Which is a better solution

Country ||--< City >--|| Region
fails under certain circumstance
Country --- City --- Regional
if region has no stores/cities = won't work
no record in middle to link together
using a variation of normal form steps to fix it in an alternative approach
there'll be a nested appraoch
ten you go with 
Country ID
Regional ID, ountry ID
Regional ID, country ID
city ID, Regional ID 
go with that IF you have to
