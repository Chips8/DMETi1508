Day 1:

Organized storage = database:
	Why use Database?
		- maintainability, easy to use, updates easily, never have redundancy in the database
		- defining
		- inserts and updates
		- sql oracle, transferrable skills
		- DCL is more security, not doing it
		- Query, puzzles, getting data out
		- It's own language and tool, distinguish themselves
Tools with everything built in: Management studios
	Note:   - Relation Database is not directly connected to database engine, 2 stage process
		- Both can connect to SQL database
		- therefore, tools and storage are separate
Relatonal Database--> stored in tables
	- stores similar information in the same table* not just any information
Note:   - Be super organzed-> inventory with inventory information
	- What tables do I need?
	- Look at paper base stuff

Introduction to Entities:
		- No tables in design, but entities
		- IN design we call our tables, entities.

	Entity: something you want to store data about.
		- Same thing different terms
Relationships:
	- How do entities relate to each other
	- Orders are placed by customers, the relationship, but there will be a table individually of customers and orders.
	- Relationships help us intertwine tables relating to one another.

Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
	- Describes the entites and their relationships
	- Customers are allowed to make 0 or 1 orders (may not be accurate)
	- Customers can only make 1 order (may not be accurate)

Attributes : (Fields, label heading, etc.)
	- To define entities

Singular Headings
	- We want to store items in tables
	- Description describes the items

Normalization:
	- Follows process like normaliziation

Instance of an entity:
	- one row / instance in the  in the entity
